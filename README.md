# LinkMe Skeleton

This repository contains a **basic skeleton** for a LinkMe‑style application built with **Next.js**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
It is designed to provide a starting point for a more advanced system with features such as profile creation, link management, analytics, shouts, search, pricing, settings, and an admin interface.

## What’s Included

* **Next.js + Tailwind CSS setup** – A minimal project configured with Tailwind for styling.
* **Pages** for common sections: home, signup, login, profile, link management, analytics, shouts, search, pricing, settings, and an admin dashboard.  
  Each page contains placeholder forms and UI elements that can be connected to your backend later.
* **Components** such as a navigation bar (`NavBar`), footer (`Footer`), and layout wrapper (`Layout`).
* A **dummy API route** at `pages/api/hello.js` to demonstrate how API routes work in Next.js.
* A sample **hero image** located in `public/hero.png` (generated via an AI tool) that you can replace or use as a background.

## What’s Missing

This is **not** a complete implementation of the detailed requirements described in the prompt. Advanced features such as analytics tracking, real‑time chat, QR code generation, payment integration, and admin moderation are **not implemented**.  
However, basic authentication and profile storage are wired up to **Supabase** as an example (see below).  
For all other features you will need to build your own backend logic or integrate additional Supabase tables and functions.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed.  
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application.

### Supabase Setup

This skeleton includes a minimal integration with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for authentication and saving user profiles.

1. Create a project on Supabase and note the **Project URL** and **Anon Public Key**.
2. In the root of this project, create a file called `.env.local` and add the following (replace placeholders with your own values):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key
```

3. In the Supabase dashboard, create a table called `profiles` with at least the following columns:

| Column    | Type    | Notes                         |
|----------|---------|-------------------------------|
| id       | uuid    | Primary key, references `auth.users.id` |
| bio      | text    | Short biography               |
| updated_at | timestamp | Timestamp of last update     |

4. Enable **Row Level Security (RLS)** on the table and add a policy that allows the owner (matching `auth.uid()`) to insert and update their own row.

Once configured, the signup and login forms will use Supabase Auth, and the profile page will save your bio into the `profiles` table.

## Extending the Skeleton

To build a full LinkMe‑style application, consider integrating the following:

* **Authentication** – Use Supabase Auth or Firebase Auth to handle user sign‑up, login, 2FA, and password resets.
* **Database** – Store user profiles, links, shouts, and analytics in Supabase or another database.
* **Storage** – Upload images and videos to Supabase Storage or Firebase Storage.
* **Analytics** – Track link clicks, device info, and generate reports.  
  You could implement custom API endpoints or use third‑party analytics tools.
* **Payments** – Integrate with Stripe or PayPal for subscription plans (Free, Pro, Business).
* **Real‑time features** – Add chat and notifications using websockets or Supabase's real‑time capabilities.
* **QR codes** – Generate QR codes for profiles using a library such as `qrcode.react`.
* **Internationalization (i18n)** – The skeleton uses Hebrew text; adapt the UI to support multiple languages with a library like `next-i18next`.

Feel free to modify or expand upon this skeleton to suit your project’s needs.
